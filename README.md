# PyBer_Analysis
An analysis of ride sharing data for the company PyBer.

## Overview of the Analysis
Our client is PyBer, a ride-sharing company. They wish for us to conduct two different analyses for this project. The specific analysis they are interested in is:
 - A summary of the data by City Type
 - A multiple-line chart of the total fares for each city type

For the analysis we were provided with the following files of data in csv format:
 - city_data.csv
 - ride_data.csv

Additionally we were provided with some starter code (PyBer_Challenge_starter_code.ipnyb) prior to starting the analysis.

The analysis was conducted using the following products:
 - Python
 - Pandas
 - Matplotlib

In addition to this written analysis we delivered a summary table, a multiple-line chart and our code in a Jupyter Notebook.
